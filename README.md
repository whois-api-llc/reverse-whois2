# Using the Reverse Whois API 2.0 web service

[Reverse Whois API](https://reverse-whois.whoisxmlapi.com/api) is used
to search for domain records based on particular search terms such as name,
email, phone, address, etc. that are usually part of Whois records.
Query results will consist of all the corresponding domain records.

Here you'll find examples of querying the API implemented in multiple
languages.

You'll need a
[WhoisXmlApi account](https://reverse-whois.whoisxmlapi.com/api/signup) to
authenticate.
You can use either the **X-Authentication-Token** header or the **apiKey**
parameter of the request's body.

Please, refer to the
[Reverse Whois API User Guide](https://reverse-whois.whoisxmlapi.com/api/documentation/making-requests)
for info on input parameters, request/response formats, authentication
instructions and more.
